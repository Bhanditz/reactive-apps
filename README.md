Reactive Apps
=============
This demo application showcases end-to-end `Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)` with Spring 5.

##### Technology stack
* Spring Framework 5
* Spring Boot 2.0.0
* Spring WebFlux
* Embedded MongoDB
* Reactive MongoDB Driver

##### Highlights
* Use of Server-Sent Events (SSE) rendered in HTML by Thymeleaf from a reactive data stream.
* Use of Server-Sent Events (SSE) rendered in JSON by Spring WebFlux from a reactive data stream. 
* Use of Spring Data MongoDB's reactive (Reactive Streams) driver support.
* Use of Spring Data MongoDB's support for infinite reactive data streams based on MongoDB tailable cursor (see [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/tailable-cursors/)). 
* Use of Thymeleaf's fully-HTML5-compatible syntax.
* Use of `webjars` for client-side dependency managements.
* Reactive Netty as a server
* Multi-project builds with Gradle Kotlin Script. 
* Kotlin as a language
* Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
* Docker deployment


### Building
```bash
# build all 3 executable jars
gradle build
# build all 3 docker images
gradle docker
```

### Testing
```bash
gradle test
```

### Running
##### Manual 
Start all 3 apps: [mongo-data-service](./mongo-data-service), [stream-service](./stream-service), [ui-app](./ui-app)
##### Docker
You can also build Docker images and run all via `Docker Compose`
```bash
# start containers in the background
docker-compose up -d
# start containers in the foreground
docker-compose up 
# show runnning containers 
docker-compose ps
# scaling containers and load balancing
docker-compose scale stream=3
# 1. stop the running containers using
docker-compose stop
# 2. remove the stopped containers using
docker-compose rm -f
```
>Access UI App at http://localhost:8080


### Gradle Commands
```bash
# upgrade project gradle version
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 3.5
# gradle daemon status 
gradle --status
gradle --stop
```
