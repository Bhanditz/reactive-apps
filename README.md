* Use of Spring Data MongoDB's reactive (Reactive Streams) driver support.
* Use of Spring Data MongoDB's support for infinite reactive data streams based on MongoDB tailable cursor (see [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/tailable-cursors/)). 
* Use of Thymeleaf's fully-HTML5-compatible syntax.
* Use of `webjars` for client-side dependency managements.
* Reactive Netty as a server
* Multi-project builds with Gradle Kotlin Script. 
* Kotlin as a language
* Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
* Docker deployment
